# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to edit, or refactor, the excel workbook Green_Stocks solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings. Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Refactoring does not add features or functionalities in a system, it helps developers in their maintenance activities. It makes a software system easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its internal structure. Refactoring improves the design of software, makes it easier to understand, helps to find bugs, helps programming times become faster, and provide a higher quality code. Although refactoring can lead to retesting lots of functionality which takes time away from the project using multiple coders to refactor the existing code.

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Refactoring preserves a clean and maintainable structure in evolving code. The benefits of refactoring are that the refactored code is generally easier to work with, has fewer bugs and is more efficient.  On the other hand it takes time way from development, and creates cascaded update issues in code that is a client of the refactored code. If you know exactly what you are going to build before starting the actual coding then that renders the refactor unnecessary. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task.
